We have heard it said, tongue-in-cheek, that
To be quite frank,
Focussing on the agreed facts, we can say that
To be perfectly truthful,
In broad terms,
To be perfectly honest,
It was |f |s who first pointed out that
Since |f |s's first formulation of the |c, it has become fairly obvious that
Since the seminal work of |f |s it has generally been accepted that
Without a doubt, |f |s iwas right in saying that
As regards |h |c, We should put this one to bed. On the other hand,
As regards |h |c, This may have a knock-on effect. On the other hand,
We must take on board that fact that
Without a doubt, |B |C |D. So, where to from here? Persumably,
It has hitherto been accepted that
At the end of the day,
Under the provision of the overall |1 plan,
Firming up the gaps, one can say that
Within the bounds of |h |c,
The |h |c provides us with a win-win situation. Especially if one considers that 
There are swings and roundabouts in considering that
To be precise,
Whilst taking the subject of  |h |c offline, one must add that
For example,
An orthodox view is that
To reiterate,
To recapitulate,
Strictly speaking,
In a very real sense,
Regarding the nature of |h |c,
In a strictly mechanistic sense,
One is struck quite forcibly by the fact that
In any event,
In particular,
In assessing the |c, one should think outside the box. on the other hand,
On the other hand,
It is recognized that
Focusing specifically on the relationship between |h |c and any |c,
Although it is fair to say that |B |C |D, one should take this out of the loop
|bly,
|bly,
|bly,
Be that as it may,
Taking everything into consideration,
As in so many cases, we can state that
The |c cannot explain all the problems in maximizing the efficacy of |h |c. Generally
We can confidently base our case on an assumption that
An initial appraisal makes it evident that
An investigation of the |1 factors suggests that
It is common knowledge that
Despite an element of volatility,
The less obviously co-existential factors imply that
To coin a phrase,
One might venture to suggest that
In all foreseeable circumstances,
However,
Similarly,
As a resultant implication,
There is a strong body of opinion that affirms that
Up to a point,
Quite frankly,
In this regard,
Based on integral subsystems,
For example,
Therefore,
Within current constraints on manpower resources,
Up to a certain point,
In an ideal environment,
It might seem reasonable to think of |h |c as involving |h |c. Nevertheless,
It can be forcibly emphasized that
Thus,
Within the restrictions of |h |c,
In respect to specific goals,
It is important to realize that
To put it concisely,
To be perfectly frank,
On any rational basis,
In any event,
On the basis of |h |2 |3,
With all the relevant considerations taken into account, it can be stated that
Few would disagree, however, that
It goes without saying that
Only in the case of the |c can one state that
if one considers the |c in the light of |h |c,
The |c is taken to be a |c. Presumably,
So far,
It is quite instructive to compare |h |c and |h |c. In the latter case,
Obviously,
By and large,
Possibly,
One can, with a certain degree of confidence, conclude that
Without doubt,
With due caution, one can postulate that
The |c is clearly related to |h |c. Nevertheless,
There is probably no causal link between the |c and |h |c. However
In the light of |h |c, it is clear that
No one can deny the relevance of |h |c. Equally it is certain that
Albeit,
It is precisely the influence of |h |c for |t that makes the |c inevitable, Equally,
One must clearly state that
In connection with |h |c,
Normally
one can, quite consistently, say that
Clearly, it is becoming possible to resolve the difficulties in assuming that
Within normal variability,
There can be little doubt that
Few would deny that
It is not often |e stated that
In real terms,
In this day and age,
It is |e stated that
The position in regard to the |c is that
On one hand |B |C |D, but on the other hand
One hears it stated that |B |C |D, but it is more likely that
Whilst it may be true that |B |C |D, one must not lose sight of the fact that
