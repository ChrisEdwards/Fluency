    <description>Fluency is a factory that creates object graphs populated with fake data. Fluency exposes a customizeable fluent interface that constructs test objects (including the full graph of dependencies). Yet it only requires you to specify the few things your test is actually concerned with--everything else is automatically populated with random (yet valid) data. Fluency comes complete with a very functional set of realistic random data generators that can be configured on a case-by-case basis or by convention to give you complete control over the randomness of your data.</description>
